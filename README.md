# Nice_Colour

Project:

This is a project to generate a colour scheme, with colors extracted from an image. The image should come from a png or jpg
format, and thus a parser has to be created that can read these formats.

Why?

  * For me I wanted to re-implement the algorithms used for color extraction. It seems that the literature 
  uses K means clustering, however I wanted to implement otherways as well.

  * I also wanted to learn how to parse low level pixel data from images. 

  * Another reason is to learn how to use git and github more effectively. I want to familiarise myself with git /
    github more.

  * Furthermore, I want to get better at my favourite language C++.

How?
  
  * First do a research paper survey of results.

  * Then do a survey of techniques.

  * Read up on image formats - .png, .jpg ect.

  * Implement the techniques incrementally.

Road Map:

  * Write a program for K means clustering.

  * Write a parser to read image file data.
