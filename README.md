# Nice_Colour

Project:

This is a project to generate a colour scheme based off of a picture. The image picture should come from a png or jpg
format, and thus a parser should be created that can read these formats.

Why?

  * For me I wanted to reimplement the algorithms used to generate a color palete for fun. It seems that the literatre 
  uses K means clustering, however I wanted to try out different ways as wekk.

  * I also wanted to learn how to process pixel data from images. Parsing low level image data sounds fun.

  * Another reason is to learn how to use git and github more effectively. I want to familiarise myself with git /
    github more.

How?
  
  * First do a research paper survey of results

  * Then do a survey of techniques

  * Read up on image formats - .png, .jpg ect.

  * Implement the techniques incrementally

  * Use C++!

Road Map:

  * Write a parser to read image file data.

  * Write a program for K means clustering.
